  * Why another RF Gateway ? 

There are may existing RF Gateways (RXFCom, RFLink..). These are great projects, but we want
to provide an opensource, free, community driven alternative.

  * How can I contribute. 

It depends on your skills, and the time you can spend on the project, but there are may ways
to help: developping new core features or new plugins, testing, provide unsupported devices
signal captures, documenting... And even help find un a logo for the project. 

Feel free to contact us through a message on Github Issue pages. 


  * Can you add support for xxxxx device. 

Please open an GitHub issue with as much details as possible (photo of the device, Signal capture)
Developpement team will try to answer you as fast as possible to analyse the capture and see if
it's possible to add support for the device.
