  * Why another RF Gateway ? 

There are other greats projects you may already know (RXFCom, RFLink, RFPlayer ...) 
With RFSkipper, we want to provide an opensource, free, community-driven alternative.


  * How can I contribute ?

It depends on your skills, and the time you can spend on the project.
There are may ways to help: developping new features or plugins if you know C/C++ and 
embedded developpement. But we also need help for testing, analyzing protocols, capturing
new signals, write documentation... or finding a cool logo for the project. 


Please leave a message on Github Issue pages to offer your help. 


  * Can you add support for xxxxx device. 

Please open an GitHub issue with as much details as possible (photo of the device, Signal capture)
Developpement team will try to answer you as fast as possible to analyse the capture and see if
it's possible to add support for the device.
